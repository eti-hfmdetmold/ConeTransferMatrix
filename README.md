# ConeTransferMatrix
Transfer Matrix implementations for Conical Waveguides. The code in this repository accompanies an arxiv preprint by Grothe et al.
"A Transfer Matrix for the Input Impedance of weakly tapered Cones as of Wind Instruments" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12750). It can be used to produce the results presented in Fig. 2.
